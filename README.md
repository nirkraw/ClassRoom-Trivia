# Classroom Trivia

## Setup Instructions

To start application please ```npm install``` and then ```npm run start``` to start server.

## Dependencies 
- "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.11.5",
- "@testing-library/react": "^11.1.0",
- "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.1.10",
- "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.2.0",
- "react": "^17.0.1",
- "react-dom": "^17.0.1",
- "react-scripts": "4.0.0",
- "web-vitals": "^0.2.4"

## Limitations

- Currently the application is run on a single json file with pre-formatted questions. To have application run on any set of questions an "add file" option would need to be available with instructions on formatting. 
- The app is run to have up to four options and more than that would create issues with formating.
